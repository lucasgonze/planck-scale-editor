# planck-scale-editor
A browser-based editor with no saves, no features, no tracking, no load time. Just a blank textarea for a scratchpad.

I often need a scratch pad for text to be used elsewhere, like in a DM or commit. For that I usually use a gist (https://gist.github.com/). However this is slow, bad for privacy, and has some annoying malfeatures.

The planck editor is a big empty textarea for a scratchpad. It is arguably a single-page app. Very very arguably.

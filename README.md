# sQratch scratchpad

I often need a quick no-frills editor to compose text to be used elsewhere, like in a DM, a commit message, or a Mastodon post. Existing tools aren't great:

- The gist editor in Github gives up PII to Microsoft and takes too long to load
- CLI editors like Emacs and vi require you to open a console window
- A full word processor like Word or GDocs takes forever to start up
- Composing an email draft distracts you with your inbox. Ditto a Slack, Discord, whatever editor. Too much distraction.

The app I'm building in this project:

- Has zero privacy loss. There are no cookies and no logs.
- Starts up superfast.
- Gets you right into the edit box with no extra steps
- Helps you focus instead of distracting you.
